# Urban metabolic flow database

This repository contains a database of processes to facilitate process-oriented urban metabolism studies, as advocated in Ravalde and Keirstead (2015), (forthcoming).

## Content

- `literature-search/`: this specifies the list of keywords used in the systematic literature search method described in Ravalde and Keirstead (2015).
- `processes/`: this contains the YAML files which define the following attributes of a process:
	- process name
	- resource inputs and outputs
	- process capacity
	- technology readiness level
	- the main resource managed by the process.

(For more details, please see the 'Data collection and database assembly' section of Ravalde and Keirstead (2015).)

## Contributing

We encourage users to contribute to the database in two ways:

1. Editing existing processes (to fill in missing information, or to revise inaccurate information).
2. Adding new processes to the database.

Additionally, we invite users to contribute auxiliary information and tools which can compliment our data in process-oriented urban metabolism studies.

1. Adding links to other open datasets in [Link](link).
2. Adding links to tools which can make use of our data [Link](link).

To contribute, first clone the repository:

	git clone git@github.com:tomravalde/metabolism-database.git

Then make any edits and additions and then [create a pull request](https://github.com/tomravalde/metabolism-database/pulls).

## TODO

- Add a changes.txt file
