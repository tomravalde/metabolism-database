# Urban metabolism process database

This repository contains a database of processes to facilitate process-oriented urban metabolism studies, as advocated in Ravalde and Keirstead (2015), (forthcoming).

## Content

- [literature-search/](literature-search) lists the keywords used in the systematic literature search method described in Ravalde and Keirstead (2015).
- [processes/](processes) contains the YAML files which define process attributes (discussed in detail in the 'Data collection and database assembly' section of Ravalde and Keirstead (2015)):
	- process name
	- resource inputs and outputs
	- process capacity
	- technology readiness level
	- the main resource managed by the process.
For details on the database construction, see the 'Data collection and database assembly' section of Ravalde and Keirstead (2015).
- [complimentary-datasets](complimentary-datasets.md) lists other datasets which can compliment our dataset (as discussed in the 'Reflections: interacting with other datasets' section of Ravalde and Keirstead (2015).
- [tools](tools.md) lists tools  which can make use of our data.

## Contributing

We encourage users to contribute to the database in two ways:

1. Editing existing processes (to fill in missing information, or to revise inaccurate information).
2. Adding new processes to the database.

Additionally, we invite users to contribute to [complimentary datasets](complimentary-datasets.md) and [tools](tools.md).

To contribute, first clone the repository:

	git clone git@github.com:tomravalde/urban-metabolism-process-database.git

Then make any edits and additions and then [create a pull request](https://github.com/tomravalde/metabolism-database/pulls).
