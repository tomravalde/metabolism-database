# Complimentary datasets

This document outlines other datasets which can compliment our data, for use in process-oriented urban metabolism studies.

## [The European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR)](http://prtr.ec.europa.eu/)

This dataset lists pollutant releases and waste transfers for over 30,000 industrial facilities within Europe. Applications are discussed in Zhu et al. (2014) and Ravalde and Keirstead (2015).
